; NAME: read_PSFs
; 
; DESCRIPTION: Read the fits file (S2013******-H-PSFs.fits) containing the high resolution psf.
; 
; Only the valid PSFs are saved in the file so that the dimensions of the array have nothing to do with the lenslets array (281x281 (x2)).
; This function sort the PSFs into an array with the dimension given in the input size. One wants it to be [281,281,1] (if "PRISM") or [281,281,2] (if "WOLLASTON").
; 
; INPUTS:
; - filename, thename of the file containing the PSFs: S2013******-H-PSFs.fits for example.
; - the size of the array corresponding to the indices stored in the variable id of the PSF structure.
; 
; OUTPUTS:  
; - return a pointer array with dimensions specified by size. The null pointers are microlens with no available PSF. The valid pointers correspond to the PSFs which were stored in the file.
;

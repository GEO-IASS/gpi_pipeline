; NAME:
;       NNLS - Nonnegative Least Squares
;
; PURPOSE: 
;	Given an m by n matrix, a, and a m-vector, b, 
;       compute and n vector, x, that solves the least spuares problem:
;	A * X = B subject to X >= 0
;
; METHOD:
;	NNLS distinguishes itself on bright, compact sources that neither
;	`CLEAN' nor MEM can process adequately. On such	sources, both 
;	CLEAN and MEM produce artifacts that resemble calibration errors 
;	and that limit dynamic range. NNLS has no difficulty imaging such 
;	sources. It also has no difficulty with sharp edges, such as 
;	those of planets or of strong shocks, and can be very advantageous 
;	in producing models for self-calibration for both types of sources. 
;	NNLS deconvolution can reach the thermal noise limit in VLBA 
;	images for which `CLEAN' produces demonstrably worse solutions.  
;	NNLS is therefore a powerful deconvolution algorithm for making 
;	high dynamic range images of compact sources for which strong 
;	finite support constraints are applicable.

;These arrays a_i, b_i, x_i, indx_i, and w_i are used in this NNLS procedure because
;IDL and most languages access an array, N, by elements 0 to N-1 while Fortran

;to access/pass arrays like most IDL programs to prevent this routine for 
;having to be completely redone after the conversion from Fortran, these temp 
;variables are used.  They are 1 cell bigger than the the values passed in

;a_i(1:100,1:100) = a(0:99, 0:99) 
;The elements are shifted back by doing the opposite:
;a(0:99,0:99) = a_i(1:100,1:100)
;this is done at the end before being passed back to the main calling routine

;This saved a considerable amount of time during the conversion of the program, 
;since it was written in a strange way to begin with in Fortran.  One could 
;not just convert the intial values to 0 from 1, the answers would not be the same 

;This array shifting also does not increase the runtime speed more than .1 second

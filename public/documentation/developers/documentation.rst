Editing Documentation (Including this Website)
================================================

Time for meta-documentation: let's document how you improve the documentation!
This web site is written using a documentation tool called `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.


Quickstart
------------

The documentation source code is available as part of the pipeline source code, in the documentation subdirectory inside the pipeline root. 

If you want to check **only** this directory out from the repository for some reason, you may do this as follows:

  >>> svn checkout https://repos.seti.org/gpi/pipeline/trunk/documentation

The source files are plain text files using a simple text markup
language called `ReStructuredText (RST)
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.  Documentation for the
syntax can be found `here <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_.  The
syntax is extremely simple and is intentionally much like the faux
formatting you probably use in your emails without thinking about it,
for instance using ``*asterisks around words*`` to indicate *italics* or ``**two asterisks**`` for  **bold**.

Look over at the right side sidebar of this page. Near its bottom is a
link "Show Source". You can click that on any page of these manuals
to see the source code for that page. Use this liberally to see how this system
works and copy formatting for use on other pages as you edit things!

Edit the RST source file(s) as desired using your favorite text editor. Commit the code back 
in with svn as usual. Once the official repository gets updated from the svn, your
changes will be visible to everyone. 


.. note::
   The official release copy at http://docs.planetimager.org/pipeline/ is only built manually,
   generally whenever there is a new version of the pipeline software released publicly.

   There is also a nightly build of the latest documentation available at http://docs.planetimager.org/pipeline_dev/




Some Sphinx Syntax Tips
---------------------------


You can include math using LaTeX syntax, for instance :math:`e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0`. The only difference from regular LaTeX 
is that you don't use dollar signs to enclose it, you use the string ":math:" and back quotes. See the `math support in Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/math.html>`_ documentation.



Installing Sphinx
------------------

You will need the `sphinx documentation tool <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ and 
its `numpydoc extension <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc>`_. We assume you already have
an installation of python; if not you will need that too. See `Installing Scientific Python <http://python4astronomers.github.com/installation/python_install.html>`_ for installation advice. 

Assuming you have the `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_ python package installer, 
you can easily install the required tools from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_::

   >>> pip install Sphinx
   >>> pip install numpydoc

Building the docs
------------------

cd to the root directory `documentation`. If Sphinx is propery installed, you should be able to just run `make html`::

    >>> make html
    [huge printout of compiling status informational messages]

    Build finished. The HTML pages are in ./doc_output/html.
      try this to examine it:
         open  ./doc_output/html/index.html


The documentation will be built to HTML and you can view it locally. A similar command on the server will 
update the documentation there. 

You can also similarly build the documentation to PDF, LaTeX, Windows Help, or several other formats as desired. Use ``make help`` to see the available output formats. 



Documenting Primitives
-------------------------


Pipeline primitive documentation is taken semi-automatically from the pipeline primitive headers 
in IDL, including the structured header comments used to populate the pipeline's primitives config file.

This is done using the ``gen_doc_primitives.py`` script in the documentation root directory. ::

   >>>  python gen_doc_primitives.py
   ==>> usage/primitives.rst


This generates the :ref:`usage/primitives <SpectralScience>` page. That page should therefore not be edited by hand since
it will be overwritten.

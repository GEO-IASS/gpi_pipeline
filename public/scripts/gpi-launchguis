# Stand alone script to launch GPI DRP IDL program.
#   (This only launches the GUI half, in case you want to restart just that part)

# Note: This code assumes that the GPI DRP code is already in your $IDL_PATH.

#requires xterms to run, so lets check for them
#set chk=`command -v xterm`
#if ( $chk == "" ) then
#    echo "xterm not found in path.  Aborting."
#    exit 1

# We need to know the GPI DRP path to invoke the proper scripts to launch the
# GUIs. If that is not already defined as an environment variable, launch IDL
# first quickly to query IDL for what the default setting is.

# start the GUIs:
\xterm -bg \#000033 -fg \#CCCC00 -geometry 80x30+20+20  -sb +ls -T 'idl: GPI DRP GUIs' -e idl $GPI_DRP_DIR/scripts/gpi-pipeline__launchguis.pro  &





# old versions of this code:
# Note: You may think we could just start the pipeline and run the commands
# directly, as in the following:
#     \xterm -bg \#000033 -fg \#FFFFAA -geometry 80x30+20+450 -sb +ls -T 'idl: GPI Pipeline' -e idl -e  "\!quiet=0 & gpipiperun "  &
# That does work to start the pipeline, **BUT** it does not give you access to
# the IDL command line in the same session. If anything goes wrong it either
# blocks or closes the IDL session entirely; either way you can't get to the IDL
# command prompt to debug. Thus, starting the way it's done above using wrapper
# procedures is the best approach. -MP

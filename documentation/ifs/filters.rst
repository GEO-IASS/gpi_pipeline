Filters and Spectra
====================


Filters
------------

GPI has five wide band filters. Because the spectral resolutions increases
toward longer wavelengths, the K band is split into two filters K1 and K2. 
These filters overlap for the 2.12-2.19 micron range. There is also a small overlap between Y and J for 1.12-1.14 microns. 


======= =============== ==============  ====================    
Filter  Min Wavelength  Max Wavelength  Spectral Resolution
======= =============== ==============  ====================    
Y       0.95            1.14            
J       1.12            1.35
H       1.50            1.79
K1      1.90            2.19
K2      2.12            2.38

======= =============== ==============  ====================    

The above table gives the 50% cut-on and cut-off wavelengths. The 10% cut-on and cut-off wavelengths are typically an additional 0.01 microns on either side. 

Filter transmission profiles are distributed as part of the GPI data pipeline, in files in the ``$GPI_DRP_DIR/pipeline/config/filters`` subdirectory. These are
vendor-provided cryogenic tests made on witness samples with identical substrate and coating produced along side the GPI IFS filters.

Spectral Layout
----------------

The wavelength dispersion axis is in the Y direction in GPI raw 2D data files.
**Longer wavelengths are toward the bottom.**

(Physically the optical plane of dispersion within the IFS is horizontal when
the instrument is level on the ground, but the X and Y axes are set by detector
fast and slow readout axes rather than being referenced to any given notion of 'horizontal' or 'vertical'). 

For a given lenslet, the pixel positions as a function of wavelength :math:`x(\lambda), y(\lambda)` are given as follows:

.. math::

  y(\lambda) = y_0 - \frac{1}{w} (\lambda - \lambda_0) \cos \theta \\
  x(\lambda) = x_0 + \frac{1}{w} (\lambda - \lambda_0) \sin \theta 

where, from a measured wavelength solution calibration as produced by the data
pipeline, :math:`x_0, y_0` are the starting positions of that lenslet at the
reference wavelength :math:`\lambda_0`, the spectral dispersion is :math:`w`
microns per pixel, and the spectral tilt with respect to the Y axis is
:math:`\theta` radians.


The spectral dispersion :math:`w` is *very roughly* 0.017 microns/pixel. 

.. warning::
   TODO update here with better information of dispersion vs filter band. It's not exactly cosntant.

IFS Flexure
==================================

Observed Effect and Relevant Physics:
---------------------------------------

The lenslet positions on the detector are subject to gravitationally induced flexure. During the course of an observation, the shifts vary in a repeatable way with elevation. However, large shifts of several pixels occur when the GPI rotates around the ___ axis, when other Gemini instruments are in use. In order to properly perform the spectral subtraction, we must compensate for this flexure.

Using Flexure Shifts in the GPI Pipeline
--------------------------------------------------

We recommend taking an Argon arc lamp contemporary with each science target for the most precise flexure measurement. (The Gemini instrument scientists will know to do this.) 

- Describe the quick wavelength solution 

Compensating for Flexure:
-----------------------------

Describe the "Update Spot Shifts for Flexure" primitive.
Describe how to tell if you flexure compensation is wrong. 
- Manual mode
- Look up table mode

- provide a picture of the resulting checkerboard pattern
- give a link to how to adjust the shift of the wavecal

Creating Calibrations:
-----------------------

**Calibration DB File Type:** Instrumental Polarization

**File Suffix:** instpol

**Generate with Recipe:**

This is not generated using a pipeline recipe - it's a complicated one-time calibration performed during
integration and test at UCSC. Contact Max or Sloane for more information.

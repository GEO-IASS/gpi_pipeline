Version 1.1
=========================================
Released TBD May 1 ish. 

This version was released in support of the GPI Early Science shared-risk observing programs by the community. It includes a range
of enhancements and fixes made during the ongoing commissioning observing runs, including in particular substantial updates to polarimetry mode support. 

.. comment:
    The following should summarize everything significant in commits from 2564 (release 1.0) through to current


* Updates for polarimetry mode:

  * Polarization waveplate angles offsets, coordinate system signs, and Stokes vector position angles all straightened out. Polarization reductions 
    now yield position angles in output files which are oriented in the usual astronomical convention of starting with 
    Stokes +Q = north. (Millar-Blanchaer)
  * Added new primitive "Clean Polarization Pairs via Double Difference" to debias polarization pairs by subtracting the median single difference bias between pairs. (Perrin)
  * Added new primitive "Subtract Mean Stellar Polarization". (Perrin)
  * Added new primitive "KLIP ADI for Pol Mode" to create total intensity disk images from polarimetry data. (Millar-Blanchaer)
  * Improvements to satellite spot handling and star position measurements for polarimetry mode. Improved stability of locating star center by setting a lower threshold in pixel value. (Wang)
  * Improved polarization mode recipe templates (Millar-Blanchaer, Perrin)
  * Lenslet coordinates in polarimetry mode match spectral mode. (Millar-Blanchaer)
  * Update "Update spot shifts for flexure" to work in polarimetry mode (Millar-Blanchaer)
  * Many bug fixes and minor updates to polarimetry primitives. (Millar-Blanchaer)
  * Improved GPItv polarimetry display; see notes in GPItv section below. 

* Enhancements/Additions to primitives and recipes:	
  
  * Added new primitive "Smooth a 3D Cube". (Millar-Blanchaer)
  * Improvements to "Calibrate Photometric Flux" primitive. (Ingraham)
  * Improved background subtraction in "Extract 1D Spectrum" (Ingraham)
  * Update to "Destripe Science Image" (Ingraham)
  * Update "wavelength solution 2D" primitive for parallelization, and for use of microlens PSFs; see note below. (Wolff) 
  * "Subtract Dark" can interpolate between dark frames taken before and after an observation. (Perrin)
  * "Destripe for Darks Only" algorithm improvements to preserve overall detector bias levels in darks, so they subtract better in science images. (Perrin)
  * Contrast profiles can be written to TXT files and FITS tables. (Savransky)
  * "Rotate North" primitive can be applied either before or after Accumulate Images. (Perrin)
  * Improved performance of locating satellite spots in spectral mode. Now can add satellite spots separation constraint. (Ingraham, Savransky)
  * Updates to inserting fake planets into cubes. (Ingraham)
  * "Rotate North" has a new option to pivot around the star location or not. Also now saves rotation angle in extension header (Millar-Blanchaer)
  * Parameter updates to default recipes. (Millar-Blanchaer, Savransky)


* Pipeline infrastructure

  * Added infrastructure code to allow primitives to modify images that have been stored by Accumulate Images. 
    This allows some primitives that work on individual images to work either before or after Accumulate Images. If before, 
    the primitive will act on each image one at a time. If after, the primitive will loop over all
    accumulated images in a row. (Perrin) 
  * Minor reordering of default order of primitives. (Perrin)
  * Fixed bug in Windows when encountering symlinks. (Maire)
  * Install script will warn but allow aliased IDL commands. (Wang)
  * Added new utility function, `get_spectral_response` to return measured spectral throughput in both direct and coronagraphic modes. (Maire)


* Recipe Editor, Data Parser, Autoreducer GUIs: 

  * Autoreducer should ignore non-GPI FITS files (Perrin)
  * Autoreducer should recognize arc lamps and run Quick Wavecal recipe template.  (Perrin)
  * Autoreducer should recognize and ignore "cleanup frames", which are throwaway frames taken 
    to allow for persistence decay between different lamps. (Wolff, Rantakyro, Perrin)
  * At Gemini, Autoreducer should now automatically change directories for different dates. (Perrin)
  * Data Parser should also ignore cleanup frames (Wolff, Perrin)
  * Data Parser and Recipe Editor get improved filenames for saving recipe files. (Perrin, Wolff)
  * Better handling of errors to mitigate GUI crashes and other unresponsive behavior. (Wang)
  * Added 'File | New' menu option in Recipe Editor to make new blank recipes. (Savransky)
  * GPI Launcher will bring to the front any existing window if you click the corresponding button. (Perrin)

* GPItv enhancements and bug fixes:

  * Overhaul of polarization vector plotting. Improved display options, more intuitive vector 
    behavior on image zooms, can display either polarized intensity or polarization fraction. (Perrin)
  * Improved UI for selecting wavecal/polcal files. (Perrin)
  * Added behavior to discard current polcal/wavecal when switching to a new file. (Perrin)
  * Fixed bugs that prevented viewing of temporary data and headers in certain cases. (Wang)
  * SDI settings for spectral cube collapsed display are now a menu item under Options, for consistency with other GPItv settings. (Savransky)
  * Better FITS metadata display for lamp cleanup frames, which are flagged using the ND4 filter.

  * Some refactoring and reorganizing routines. (Perrin, Wolff)
  * Fix nonfunctional 'Remove File' button in Recipe Editor and Data Parser GUIs. (Rajan, Perrin)
  * "Measure Distortion" primitive was disabled since distortion correction is a lab calibration rather than routine on-sky task. (Maire)
  * Better error handling in gpitv if flexure shifts lookup file not present (Ingraham)
  * Better edge case handling in gpitv if sat spot positions are recorded in the 
    FITS header but fluxes are not (Wang)
  * Minor fixes to 'Destripe Science Image' primitive. (Ingraham)
  * In /nogui mode, Rescan CalDB shouldn't try to update nonexistent Status Console window (Perrin)

  * Improved code clarity and variable names in wavelength solution primitive, remove redundant double save of the output file. (Wolff)
  * Fix datestring bug for engineering mode ("E" filename) FITS files (Savransky)
  * Path cleanup for install: remove hard coded filter paths, add trailing slashes unformly for consistency across unix systems (Ingraham, Wang)
  * Minor debugging: remove some debug print statements, code cleanup, etc. (team)
  * Updated pipeline constants. (Perrin, Ingraham) 
  * Better filename handling, parsing, and creation. (Millar-Blanchaer, Perrin, Wang, Wolff)
 

.. admonition:: Advertisement: SPIE talks on GPI Data Pipeline 

 Want to learn more details on how to calibrate and reduce GPI data? The GPI data pipeline, its algorithms, and 
 calibrations for the instrument will be discussed in detail in 13 presentations at the SPIE meeting this summer. 

 In addition to the changes listed above, many code commits were made relevant
 to new primitives for the creation and use of high-resolution subpixel sampled
 microlens PSF models. These algorithms are not quite ready for prime time
 yet and are not included in the public release. Stay tuned for 1.2 this fall, and/or see the
 presentations by Ingraham,  Draper, and Wolff at the SPIE this summer.

Version 0.9.3
=========================================
Released 2013 Nov 12

This version was released for GPI first light at Gemini South. This includes
updates and enhancements based on testing at Gemini in September and October 2013.


* New Primitives:

  * New and improved "2D Wavelength Solution" (a.k.a. "Wavecal 2.0") algorithm,
    which works by fitting a forward model to the lenslet spectra pixels
    directly in 2D, rather than measuring each peak sequentially then fitting a
    line in 1D.  This algorithm is demonstrably more robust, more precise, and
    better able to handle overlapping adjacent spectra and various noise
    sources than the original algorithm.  A prior wavecal from the Calibration
    Database is used as a starting guess for each fit rather than starting from
    zero a priori knowledge each time, Further improving robustness.  Extensive
    testing has shown this new algorithm is strictly better than the old
    algorithm (which is retained in the pipeline still as an option in any
    case) in every respect except for being slower. Two versions of this
    algorithm are provided, one which is single threaded and a parallelized
    implementation for use on multi-core machnes. (Wolff)
  * Derived primitive "Quick Wavelength Solution Update" based on the above, which only fits
    every ~400th lenslet (adjustible) and then applies an appropriate average
    bulk shift to the best available prior wavecal from CalDB. This provides an ability to 
    generate "Quicklook" quality wavecals in very short run time (Perrin & Wolff).
  * New ADI KLIP primitive, "KLIP algorithm Angular Differential Imaging". (Savransky)
  * New primitive "Flag as Quicklook" that sets a QUIKLOOK=True FITS header
    keyword in output files. (Perrin)
  * New primitive "Create Symbolic Links" for those times when you really want to make
    it looks like one file is being written to two different places.  Only works on
    POSIX compliant operating systems, e.g. Mac OS and Linux. 
  


* Pipeline infrastructure and enhancements to existing primitives: 

  * SDI KLIP algorithm performance dramatically sped up by about 3-4x.  Updates to accumulate_images framework
    to allow retrieving images slice by slice. 
  * Now will detect if the pipeline is about to overwrite an existing output file, and
    (depending on the value of a new file_overwrite_handling setting) either prompt the user what should be done, 
    overwrite it, write the new file to a different output name, or don't write anything at all but raise an error. (Perrin)
  * Adds DATALAB keyword support and swap to underscores for suffixes. Closes issue 311
  * Implement scaling for dark subtractions with non-identical exposure times of science images and the reference darks;
    closes action 173 from Pre-Ship Review Report.
  * New utility function gpi_sanity_check_wavecal provides quality checks on
    derived wavelength calibrations. 
  * Polarization spot position measurement primitive parallelized for much improved speed.
  * Improved update_wcs_basic command that does precise calculations of AVPARANG and MJD-AVG
  * Define a new pipeline setting "at_gemini", which enables several small adjustments
    in file paths and wildcards suitable for the case of the pipeline running integrated into the
    Gemini network on Cerro Pachon. If you're not one of the observatory computers on the summit, this is not expected to be of use to you. (Perrin)
  * New utility function gpi_get_ifs_lenslet_scale for consistent calculations everywhere (Savransky)
  * Updated accumulate_getimage to optionally return single slices (Savransky)
  * Improvements to the Recipe class (DRF) internal implementation. (Perrin)
  * Infrastructure and tools in preparation for eventual next-generation data cube extraction algorithm (Ingraham)
  * Updated handling of sat spot locations in header.
  * Updated WCS handling with proper coordinate rotation as determined prior to being on sky. (Perrin, Thomas, Chilcote, Savransky)

* Recipe Editor, Data Parser, Autoreducer GUIS: 

  * Major revision/refactoring of Recipe Editor code. Now uses Recipe class internally for improved abstraction and better overall
    code clarity and ease of long term maintenance.  While the GUI has not changed substantially, this was a
    major overhaul to the internals of this tool. (Perrin)
  * 

* GPItv enhancements and bug fixes:

  * Add display of the mean stellar position across all wavelengths to the Star Position plot. (Perrin)
  * Bug fix sign error for Rotate North Up; add WCS existence check for auto-handedness function
    
* Improved documentation and installation guide (Ingraham, Perrin). 

  * New FAQ section in the docs (Ingraham)

* Source code housekeeping:

  * Subversion repository reorganized to use standard "trunk", "tags", "branches" directories. (Perrin)

* Miscellaneous bug fixes and minor tasks:

  * 2D plotting should reuse an existing IDL graphics window by default if possible.
  * Remove obsolete user-changable suffixes feature.  (Perrin)
  * improved handling for absolute path specs in the middle of a filename string
  * Improved logging in several places. (Perrin)
  * Clean up of deprecated code (Ingraham)
  * Better error message text for read only versus missing output directories (Perrin, Ingraham?
  * Removed all direct use of CDELT1 & CDELT2 keywords - everything is now handled through extast and getrot. Addressed bug 325. (Savransky)
  * Various minor bug fixes, typo corrections, and other small stuff.  (Perrin, Ingraham, Savransky)

Version: 0.9.1 
=========================================
Released 2013 June 18.

Version 0.9.1 was 
released at the end of GPI acceptance testing at UCSC. This version
incorporates many enhancements and lessons learned based on GPI pre-ship acceptance testing.



* Initial implementation of IFS flexure spectral shift handling. (Maire, Perrin, Ingraham)
 
    * New primitives to measure spectral shifts based on test data, populate a
      lookup table of spectral displacements on the H2RG as a function of
      instrument elevation angle, and apply corrective shifts to wavelength
      solution data prior to datacube extraction
    * Applied shifts tracked in FITS header keywords SPOT_DX, SPOT_DY in reduced data products. 
    * Autoreducer GUI enhanced with options to control the above. 

* Destriping algorithms for darks and science enhanced to remove microphonics noise via Fourier filtering.  (Perrin, Ingraham, Ruffio)

* New primitive for persistence correction (Ingraham)

* Algorithm improvements and updated primitive for distortion correction (Maire, Konopacky)

* More robust polarization mode spot location calibration algorithm (Millar-Blanchaer)

* New primitive and recipe for generating cold bad pixel map from multi filter flats. (Perrin, Marois)

* Data parser now generates recipes for cold and hot and combined bad pixels
  maps if given suitable input data.  (Perrin)

    * Hot pixel maps generated from the longest available dark sequence,
      provided it has ITIME > 60 s and there are at least 10 dark files in the
      set. 

    * Cold bad pixel maps generated from all available flat files, provided
      there are at least 3 distinct filters. (TBD if 3 is sufficient. More is
      better for this purpose.)

    * Combined bad pixel maps generated if either of the above is invoked.

* New algorithm for low spatial frequency flat field generation (Ruffio)

* New recipe template for LOCI reductions (Maire)

* Off-by-one rounding bug fix in data cube extraction (Ruffio)

* Use identical SDI function in pipeline primitive and GPItv (Marois)

* Updates to speckle alignment backend (Savransky)

* Pickles library of stellar spectra now included in config data directory, for use in photometric calibration routines (Perrin)

* Updated wavecal routine to only allow reasonable lamp/filter combinations (Maire, Ingraham)

* Various minor bug fixes, aesthetic cleanup of FITS keywords, improved logging, and other minor miscellany (Ingraham, Ruffio, Savransky, Millar-Blanchaer, Maire, Perrin)



Version 0.9.0
=========================================
Released 2013 February 8

Version 0.9.0 was used for GPI acceptance testing at UCSC.

* Adds destriping algorithms to mitigate IFS detector electronic noise pickup. (Ingraham, Perrin)


* The calibration database is now aware of IFS cooldowns and warm ups, and will
  by default refuse to use calibration files from a different cooldown.
  (Because hot pixels, darks, etc, change so much between detector thermal
  cycles, this is the right default). If you want to temporarily disable this
  at the start of a run so you can e.g. use existing wavelength solutions
  before you have had time to take new better ones, this can be done easily
  just by changing a flag in the pipeline config file.  (Perrin)

* Other Calibration Database various improvements.

*   The "automatic reducer" pipeline window now has a new option, which
    lets you select a specific reduction recipe template to apply to each new IFS
    data file as it is taken. The default remains the same, a basic datacube recipe
    without much calibration, but this lets you override that default with a
    different recipe if you so desire (for instance, Dmitry wants a recipe to
    produce speckle-aligned data cubes when he's doing a speckle nulling
    experiment.)  (Perrin)

*   Error checking in gpitv has been enhanced so that, if/when it encounters an
    error, it will just print the error message on screen and then return to normal
    execution, rather than stopping in the debugger and freezing the IDL widget
    program event loop. This should prevent any viewer program errors from pausing
    execution of the automatic reducer. (Savransky, Perrin)

*   New graphical tool 'gpicaldbview'. This displays a nice tabular interface
    to view/search the current contents of the calibration database. (Probably of
    interest primarily to pipeline developers; for normal users it remains the case
    that the CalibDB will always automatically provide the best available
    calibrations during data reduction.)   (Perrin)

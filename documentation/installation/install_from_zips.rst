Installing from Software Release Zip Files
=============================================

This section describes how to install the pipeline from Zip files containing
released source code of the pipeline. This is appropriate for anyone who **has** a
full copy of IDL, but does not immediately intend to contribute to ongoing
pipeline development. 

.. note::
    This method requires you have an IDL license. If you do not have an IDL
    license, please refer to  :ref:`this page <installing-from-compiled>` for 
    installing compiled executables instead.

Unzip this file in a directory that is a part of your ``$IDL_PATH`` (To determine where your ``$IDL_PATH`` is, type ``echo $IDL_PATH`` in a terminal prompt.

  On Mac OS and Linux, you will likely want to add the ``pipeline/scripts`` subdirectory
  to your shell's ``$PATH``. How you do this depends upon your chosen shell (sh, csh, tcsh, bash etc). This is addressed in the :ref:`configuring` section. 


.. warning::
   The usual caveats about name collisions between different versions of IDL routines apply.
   If you have old versions of e.g. the Goddard IDL library functions in your ``$IDL_PATH``, 
   you may encounter difficulties. We suggest placing the data pipeline code first in your ``$IDL_PATH``. More information can be found in the :ref:`frequently-asked-questions` section. 
   

Proceed now to :ref:`configuring`.

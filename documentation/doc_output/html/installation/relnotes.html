<p>Released 2015 April 1, for Gemini 2015A</p>
<div class="admonition-after-upgrading-you-must-reindex-your-calibration-database admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">After upgrading, you must reindex your calibration database</p>
<p class="last">The Calibration Database now indexes some additional fields, in particular
telescope elevation which is now used when matching wavelength calibration
files. As a result, <em>after upgrading to version 1.3 of the pipeline you
must rescan the calibration database to reindex the FITS headers</em>, or the
pipeline will not operate properly.  Just press the &#8220;Rescan Calibration
Database&#8221; button in the Status Console after you have updated and restarted
the pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-after-upgrading-you-must-download-an-updated-distortion-correction-calibration-file admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">After upgrading, you must download an updated distortion correction calibration file</p>
<p class="last">Improvements in the distortion correction algorithm necessitated an
accompanying update to the file of polynomial coefficients used to describe
the measured distortion. <em>Users will need to download an updated distortion
correction file for use with version 1.3</em>.  The Correct Distortion
primitive will not work with the older calibration file and will raise an
error. The updated file should be obtainable from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/gpi/public-data">Gemini GPI public
data page</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-improvements-in-astrometry-near-zenith admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Improvements in astrometry near zenith</p>
<p class="last">Prior versions of the pipeline have been subject to some biases in
parallactic angle calculation for targets that transit very close to
zenith, for which the field rotation rate can be up to several degrees per
exposure.  This version of the pipeline more carefully compensates for the
time offset between FITS header writing and the midpoint of the frame
exposure time, and as a result yields more accurate astrometry for
exposures very close to zenith.  <em>We recommend reprocessing earlier data
with this current version of the pipeline if your target passes within 5-10
deg of zenith, particularly if you are comparing astrometry across multiple
epochs for e.g. proper motion confirmation.</em></p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Enhancements/Additions to primitives and recipes:<ul>
<li>Remove Persistence primitive algorithm improvements to better handle UTR mode and coadds.  (Ingraham)</li>
<li>Remove Persistence primitive gains keyword parameter to manually override the end time of the previous exposure, if necessary. (Ingraham)</li>
<li>updated contrasts in GPITV and the Measure Contrast to use precisely the same algorithm for individual slices. Also modified the plotting
colors and labels for clarity. Also updated default slice in Measure Contrast changed plot legend to make it easier to read. (Ingraham)</li>
<li>New primitive &#8220;Save Accumulated Stack&#8221; to save all images at once in a batch, for instance after PSF subtraction. (Millar-Blanchaer)</li>
<li>Updates to high pass filtering in quicklook spectral recipe (Ingraham)</li>
<li>Bug fix to &#8220;Interpolate Bad Pixels in 2D frames&#8221; to avoid dividing by zero causing NANs in final image products under some circumstances (Wolff).</li>
<li>Improved algorithm for &#8220;Correct Distortion&#8221; primitive that conserves flux when resampling (Fitzgerald, Konopacky).</li>
<li>For &#8220;Quick Wavelength Solution&#8221;, better constrained the allowed x/y shifts in the initial cross correlation of old and new wavecals. (Wolff)</li>
<li>Added error checking for suitable input files to &#8220;Flexure Cross Correlation with Polcal&#8221; (Millar-Blanchaer)</li>
<li>Updated &#8220;Contrast Measurement&#8221; recipe template to measure contrast from all wavelengths (Follette)</li>
<li>Algorithm improvement to &#8220;Combine 2D Dark Images&#8221; for better read noise estimation on coadded images (Follette)</li>
<li>Added keywords to &#8220;Subtract Mean Stellar Polarization&#8221; to allow fine-tuning the region used for estimating stellar polarization. (Hung)</li>
<li>Updated parallelization options to &#8220;Filter Datacube Spatially&#8221; (Ingraham)</li>
<li>New recipe to make low-frequency filtered flat fields in polarization mode. (Millar-Blanchaer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhancements to instrument characterization<ul>
<li>Improved algorithms for calculating time-averaged parallactic angles very near zenith, where fields are very rapidly rotating.
Provides improved astrometric precision for exposures on objects transiting near zenith as noted above. (Nielsen)</li>
<li>Rotation matrices for World Coordinate System headers and other uses are now all derived from
AVPARANG (the time-averaged parallactic angle over the course of the exposure computed by this pipeline)
instead of PAR_ANG (the instantaneous parallactic angle at the time when the Gemini Data System saved state
for the FITS header, several seconds before the exposure actually started). (Nielsen)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GPItv enhancements and bug fixes:<ul>
<li>New &#8220;Create SNR Map&#8221; option added to cube display drop-down menu. This normalizes the displayed image by the measured contrast curve, with the goal of making point sources equally visually apparent on a single image stretch regardless of separation from the central star. Note this is a quick convenience mode only, and is not intended as a publication-quality assessment of the significance of any particular detection!  (Ingraham)</li>
<li>Low pass filter option added to enable smoothing of background noise. Select &#8220;Low Pass Filter&#8221; option from the cube display drop-down menu. Right now the low pass filter size is hard-coded to use the typical GPI PSF FWHM for each of the filters. (Ingraham)</li>
<li>Avoid displaying unnecessary flexure plot when overplotting wavecals in GPItv (Ingraham)</li>
<li>Updated the gpitv contrast plot to display the wavelength of the slice when only one slice&#8217;s contrast is plotted. (Wolff)</li>
<li>New display mode for Q and U Stokes parameters normalized by total intensity (Millar-Blanchaer)</li>
<li>For at Gemini South, fix Browse Files window&#8217;s buttons for &#8220;Today&#8217;s Raw Data&#8221; and &#8220;Today&#8217;s Reduced Data&#8221; (Ingraham)</li>
<li>For at Gemini South, fix GPItv file dialogs to avoid trying to list the tens of thousands of files in the /dhs/perm directory.</li>
<li>Removed contrast plots from SNR map mode for clarity (Ingraham)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recipe Editor, Data Parser, Autoreducer GUIs:<ul>
<li>Data Parser code split in two (parsergui for the widget user interface, parsercore for the actual recipe generation logic), to better enable the
data parsing algorithms to be called as a subroutine from other codes. See example code in parsercore__define for usage. Added infrastructure
classes for file sets and added functionality to Recipe/DRF class to support this. (Perrin)</li>
<li>Data Parser now also outputs Low Frequency Flat Field recipe for polarization flats (Millar-Blanchaer)</li>
<li>Bug fix for an unusual edge-case issue with FITS keywords when loading reduced files from the Calibrations directory directly into the Recipe Editor (Ingraham)</li>
<li>Autoreducer options for manually adjusting wavecal position now can also be used to adjust polcals (Millar-Blanchaer)</li>
<li>Improvements to Recipe Editor GUI to better display template names when opening existing recipes, and generally improve the user interface for selecting a new recipe template (Savransky)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Infrastructure improvements<ul>
<li>Improved calibration database algorithm for selection of wavecal to choose wavecals that are closest in both
time and telescope elevation, preferring the quick wavecals taken just before each science sequence (Wolff).</li>
<li>Added detector linearization calibration file type to Calibraton DB</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved documentation and tutorials<ul>
<li>Additions to FAQ: Answer question about pipeline log problems due to IDL license server issues (Perrin)</li>
<li>Added documentation for new Save Accumulated Stack primitive (Millar-Blanchaer)</li>
<li>Updated recipe editor docs to reflect UI changes (Savransky)</li>
<li>Improved documentation about flux-conserving distortion correction (Perrin)</li>
<li>Added gallery of example artifacts in GPI data (De Rosa, Perrin)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes and minor tasks:<ul>
<li>GPITV&#8217;s Browse Files window does better at ignoring non-GPI files (Ingraham) but will still open GPI pupil viewer files that lack INSTRUME keyword anyway (Perrin)</li>
<li>Better error checking for update_prev_saved_fits_header functionality in Measure Sat Spots Location, Flux, and Contrast primitives (Perrin)</li>
<li>Typo bug fix in gpi_extract_1d_spectrum (Ingraham)</li>
<li>Minor fixes to Wavelength Solution code output error messages and warnings. Improved error handling in wavecal algorithm utility functions. (Wolff)</li>
<li>Now correctly computes average parallactic angle in the rare case that UT midnight occurs during the exposure, as well as the even-rarer
case where UT midnight occurs in the 3 seconds after the FITS header is written but before the exposure starts. (Nielsen)</li>
<li>Bug fix for use of shared memory in Parallelized Polarization Spot Calibration (Millar-Blanchaer)</li>
<li>Deprecated the gpi_assemble_datacube wrapper primitive; use Assemble Spectral Datacube or Assemble Polarization Datacube instead.</li>
<li>Removed old deprecated test* primitives, left over from pre-first-light pipeline development. Removed old deprecated primitives with
alternate algorithms (not recommended, from pre-first-light) for telluric calibration, photometric calibration. (Ingraham, Maire)</li>
<li>Fix spelling mistakes in a few primitives (Ingraham)</li>
<li>Added parallelized version of high pass filter algorithm, which can save a few seconds in some circumstances for GPItv or
Filter Datacube Spatially primitive (Perrin). But also avoid trying the parallelized version at the Gemini South summit since the IDL license
server there is very slow to start parallel sessions so it&#8217;s actually slower  (Perrin).</li>
<li>Added wait when copying xml files to ensure that copy completes before loading file (Ingraham)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other<ul>
<li>GPItv gained a GPIES-campaign specific tool for marking file status (good/bad) and adding comments to the GPIES campaign database (ImageInfo menu, &#8220;Mark File Status&#8221;). This option will do nothing and be quietly ignored for users who do not have GPIES-campaign Dropbox access.  (Savransky)</li>

<p>Released 2014 October 31.</p>
<p>This release incorporates updates and enhancements for 2014B. Thanks to the users in 2014A and members of the GPI and Gemini team who contributed improvements.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The World Coordinate System calibration for GPI was updated in accordance
with the results of Konopacky et al. (2014). This changes the pixel scale
and orientation of north that are written into datacube FITS headers. Datacubes
reduced with the current version of the pipeline should have more
accurate orientations than prior versions. However, please bear in mind
that if you compare datacubes reduced with older versions of the pipeline
to datacubes reduced with the new one, you may find a spurious offset in position angle
or separation.  Users should take care and perform their own calibrations when
doing high precision astrometry.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Enhancements/Additions to primitives and recipes:<ul>
<li>New primitive: &#8220;Correct ADR Shift&#8221; applies a software correction for atmospheric differential refraction (ADR).</li>
<li>New primitive: &#8220;Filter Datacube Spatially&#8221; applies high pass filter to datacubes, similar to the GPItv display option.</li>
<li>New primitive: &#8220;Flexure 2D x correlation with polcal&#8221; uses cross correlation to automatically derive flexure corrections for polarimetry mode.</li>
<li>Destriping for Darks primitive now preserves the mean bias level of reduced dark files, to better subtract that bias from science images. Dark generation and hot pixel identification primitives updated for compatibility. (Perrin)</li>
<li>Distortion correction primitive can now work either before Accumulate Images (undistorts one image at a time) or after it (undistorts all previously accumulated images) (Perrin)</li>
<li>Update Spot Shifts for Flexure gains a new mode, &#8220;bandshift&#8221;, which takes into account the known offsets between spectral bands to calculate a flexure-corrected wavelength solution for any filter based on H band argon lamp images. (Wolff)</li>
<li>Update Spot Shifts for Flexure also now can apply spatially-variable offsets across the field of view, to account for the second order flexure correction.</li>
<li>Improvements in wavecal solution code to accomodate microlens PSF option as well as Gaussian PSFs. Improvements to smooth and filter the derived wavelength solutions to improve S/N and better handle lenslets at edge of FOV. (Wolff)</li>
<li>Improvements to Sat Spot measurements in polarization mode (Wang, Millar-Blanchaer)</li>
<li>Subtract Stellar Polarization primitive uses star position from sat spots. Can also be applied to a single polarization datacube (podc file) instead of Stokes datacube (stokesdc file).  (Millar-Blanchaer).</li>
<li>Significant improvements to detector persistence model and persistence correction (Ingraham).</li>
<li>Improved polarization datacube extraction using empirical Gaussian model lenslet PSFs for weighted extraction (Millar-Blanchaer, Fitzgerald)</li>
<li>Algorithm improvements to photometric calibration calculation. (Ingraham)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhancements to instrument characterization<ul>
<li>Updated zero point fluxes in pipeline_constants to values calculated using the instrument response curves and not the filter profiles - differences are very minor (Ingraham).</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>GPItv enhancements and bug fixes:<ul>
<li>Minor bug fix to histogram window (Perrin)</li>
<li>GPItv display of wavelength solution has gained a mouse mode enabling dragging the solution around interactively. This updates the dx and dy parameters displayed in gpitv, which can then be copied into the autoreducer or recipe editor for use when creating datacubes. (Wolff)</li>
<li>For polarimetry files, GPItv can now compute and display radial stokes vectors, and also a normalized differences display (Millar-Blanchaer).</li>
<li>GPItv contrast plot display bug fix for cases with small Y axis range (Nielsen)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recipe Editor, Data Parser, Autoreducer GUIs:<ul>

<h2>Version 0.9.3<a class="headerlink" href="#version-0-9-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Released 2013 Nov 12</p>
<p>This version was released for GPI first light at Gemini South. This includes
updates and enhancements based on testing at Gemini in September and October 2013.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>New Primitives:<ul>
<li>New and improved &#8220;2D Wavelength Solution&#8221; (a.k.a. &#8220;Wavecal 2.0&#8221;) algorithm,
which works by fitting a forward model to the lenslet spectra pixels
directly in 2D, rather than measuring each peak sequentially then fitting a
line in 1D.  This algorithm is demonstrably more robust, more precise, and
better able to handle overlapping adjacent spectra and various noise
sources than the original algorithm.  A prior wavecal from the Calibration
Database is used as a starting guess for each fit rather than starting from
zero a priori knowledge each time, Further improving robustness.  Extensive
testing has shown this new algorithm is strictly better than the old
algorithm (which is retained in the pipeline still as an option in any
case) in every respect except for being slower. Two versions of this
algorithm are provided, one which is single threaded and a parallelized
implementation for use on multi-core machnes. (Wolff)</li>
<li>Derived primitive &#8220;Quick Wavelength Solution Update&#8221; based on the above, which only fits
every ~400th lenslet (adjustible) and then applies an appropriate average
bulk shift to the best available prior wavecal from CalDB. This provides an ability to
generate &#8220;Quicklook&#8221; quality wavecals in very short run time (Perrin &amp; Wolff).</li>
<li>New ADI KLIP primitive, &#8220;KLIP algorithm Angular Differential Imaging&#8221;. (Savransky)</li>
<li>New primitive &#8220;Flag as Quicklook&#8221; that sets a QUIKLOOK=True FITS header
keyword in output files. (Perrin)</li>
<li>New primitive &#8220;Create Symbolic Links&#8221; for those times when you really want to make
it looks like one file is being written to two different places.  Only works on
POSIX compliant operating systems, e.g. Mac OS and Linux.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pipeline infrastructure and enhancements to existing primitives:<ul>
<li>SDI KLIP algorithm performance dramatically sped up by about 3-4x.  Updates to accumulate_images framework
to allow retrieving images slice by slice.</li>
<li>Now will detect if the pipeline is about to overwrite an existing output file, and
(depending on the value of a new file_overwrite_handling setting) either prompt the user what should be done,
overwrite it, write the new file to a different output name, or don&#8217;t write anything at all but raise an error. (Perrin)</li>
<li>Adds DATALAB keyword support and swap to underscores for suffixes. Closes issue 311</li>
<li>Implement scaling for dark subtractions with non-identical exposure times of science images and the reference darks;
closes action 173 from Pre-Ship Review Report.</li>
<li>New utility function gpi_sanity_check_wavecal provides quality checks on
derived wavelength calibrations.</li>
<li>Polarization spot position measurement primitive parallelized for much improved speed.</li>
<li>Improved update_wcs_basic command that does precise calculations of AVPARANG and MJD-AVG</li>
<li>Define a new pipeline setting &#8220;at_gemini&#8221;, which enables several small adjustments
in file paths and wildcards suitable for the case of the pipeline running integrated into the
Gemini network on Cerro Pachon. If you&#8217;re not one of the observatory computers on the summit, this is not expected to be of use to you. (Perrin)</li>
<li>New utility function gpi_get_ifs_lenslet_scale for consistent calculations everywhere (Savransky)</li>
<li>Updated accumulate_getimage to optionally return single slices (Savransky)</li>
<li>Improvements to the Recipe class (DRF) internal implementation. (Perrin)</li>
<li>Infrastructure and tools in preparation for eventual next-generation data cube extraction algorithm (Ingraham)</li>
<li>Updated handling of sat spot locations in header.</li>
<li>Updated WCS handling with proper coordinate rotation as determined prior to being on sky. (Perrin, Thomas, Chilcote, Savransky)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recipe Editor, Data Parser, Autoreducer GUIS:<ul>
<li>Major revision/refactoring of Recipe Editor code. Now uses Recipe class internally for improved abstraction and better overall
code clarity and ease of long term maintenance.  While the GUI has not changed substantially, this was a
major overhaul to the internals of this tool. (Perrin)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GPItv enhancements and bug fixes:<ul>
<li>Add display of the mean stellar position across all wavelengths to the Star Position plot. (Perrin)</li>
<li>Bug fix sign error for Rotate North Up; add WCS existence check for auto-handedness function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved documentation and installation guide (Ingraham, Perrin).<ul>
<li>New FAQ section in the docs (Ingraham)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Source code housekeeping:<ul>
<li>Subversion repository reorganized to use standard &#8220;trunk&#8221;, &#8220;tags&#8221;, &#8220;branches&#8221; directories. (Perrin)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes and minor tasks:<ul>
<li>2D plotting should reuse an existing IDL graphics window by default if possible.</li>
<li>Remove obsolete user-changable suffixes feature.  (Perrin)</li>
<li>improved handling for absolute path specs in the middle of a filename string</li>
<li>Improved logging in several places. (Perrin)</li>
<li>Clean up of deprecated code (Ingraham)</li>
<li>Better error message text for read only versus missing output directories (Perrin, Ingraham?</li>
<li>Removed all direct use of CDELT1 &amp; CDELT2 keywords - everything is now handled through extast and getrot. Addressed bug 325. (Savransky)</li>
<li>Various minor bug fixes, typo corrections, and other small stuff.  (Perrin, Ingraham, Savransky)</li>

<h2>Version: 0.9.1<a class="headerlink" href="#version-0-9-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Released 2013 June 18.</p>
<p>Version 0.9.1 was
released at the end of GPI acceptance testing at UCSC. This version
incorporates many enhancements and lessons learned based on GPI pre-ship acceptance testing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Initial implementation of IFS flexure spectral shift handling. (Maire, Perrin, Ingraham)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>New primitives to measure spectral shifts based on test data, populate a
lookup table of spectral displacements on the H2RG as a function of
instrument elevation angle, and apply corrective shifts to wavelength
solution data prior to datacube extraction</li>
<li>Applied shifts tracked in FITS header keywords SPOT_DX, SPOT_DY in reduced data products.</li>
<li>Autoreducer GUI enhanced with options to control the above.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Destriping algorithms for darks and science enhanced to remove microphonics noise via Fourier filtering.  (Perrin, Ingraham, Ruffio)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">New primitive for persistence correction (Ingraham)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Algorithm improvements and updated primitive for distortion correction (Maire, Konopacky)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">More robust polarization mode spot location calibration algorithm (Millar-Blanchaer)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">New primitive and recipe for generating cold bad pixel map from multi filter flats. (Perrin, Marois)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Data parser now generates recipes for cold and hot and combined bad pixels
maps if given suitable input data.  (Perrin)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Hot pixel maps generated from the longest available dark sequence,
provided it has ITIME &gt; 60 s and there are at least 10 dark files in the
set.</li>
<li>Cold bad pixel maps generated from all available flat files, provided
there are at least 3 distinct filters. (TBD if 3 is sufficient. More is
better for this purpose.)</li>
<li>Combined bad pixel maps generated if either of the above is invoked.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">New algorithm for low spatial frequency flat field generation (Ruffio)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">New recipe template for LOCI reductions (Maire)</p>
</li>

<h2>Version 0.9.0<a class="headerlink" href="#version-0-9-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Released 2013 February 8</p>
<p>Version 0.9.0 was used for GPI acceptance testing at UCSC.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Adds destriping algorithms to mitigate IFS detector electronic noise pickup. (Ingraham, Perrin)</li>
<li>The calibration database is now aware of IFS cooldowns and warm ups, and will
by default refuse to use calibration files from a different cooldown.
(Because hot pixels, darks, etc, change so much between detector thermal
cycles, this is the right default). If you want to temporarily disable this
at the start of a run so you can e.g. use existing wavelength solutions
before you have had time to take new better ones, this can be done easily
just by changing a flag in the pipeline config file.  (Perrin)</li>
<li>Other Calibration Database various improvements.</li>
<li>The &#8220;automatic reducer&#8221; pipeline window now has a new option, which
lets you select a specific reduction recipe template to apply to each new IFS
data file as it is taken. The default remains the same, a basic datacube recipe
without much calibration, but this lets you override that default with a
different recipe if you so desire (for instance, Dmitry wants a recipe to
produce speckle-aligned data cubes when he&#8217;s doing a speckle nulling
experiment.)  (Perrin)</li>
<li>Error checking in gpitv has been enhanced so that, if/when it encounters an
error, it will just print the error message on screen and then return to normal
execution, rather than stopping in the debugger and freezing the IDL widget
program event loop. This should prevent any viewer program errors from pausing
execution of the automatic reducer. (Savransky, Perrin)</li>
<li>New graphical tool &#8216;gpicaldbview&#8217;. This displays a nice tabular interface
to view/search the current contents of the calibration database. (Probably of
interest primarily to pipeline developers; for normal users it remains the case
that the CalibDB will always automatically provide the best available
calibrations during data reduction.)   (Perrin)</li>

.. _intro:

This document describes the internal workings of the GPI pipeline, and provides information 
on how to maintain, modify, and enhance it. It also tells you how to :ref:`improve this documentation <documentation>`.

.. warning::
        Compared to the other GPI pipeline docs, this is currently 
        pretty rough - please treat this document as a work in progress!

:ref:`Installation & Configuration <installation>` and :ref:`User's Guide <user-intro>` sections. 

See the :ref:`development credits <sw-credits>` page for a list of GPI instrument team and Gemini staff members who have contributed to this project.

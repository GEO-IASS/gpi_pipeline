Recommended Reading
========================

Here is a (partial, incomplete) bibliography of useful works to consult about GPI and working with GPI data. 


GPI Data Reduction
--------------------

Our team published a series of ten papers at the 2014 SPIE Astronomical Telescopes & Instrumentation meeting discussing in detail our understanding of GPI data and its analysis as of six months after first light.  Readers are strongly encouraged to take a look!

GPI Misc. Reference Materials
################################

We're now moving beyond material that is pipeline documentation, into the more 
general area of ancillary documentation of GPI as an instrument. 

.. warning::
        This is a WORKING DRAFT document, which is not fully complete and may
        be in error in some places. It represents our current
        understanding of these aspects of instrument performance, and is
        likely to evolve with time. Use your own scientific judgement when
        reducing and analyzing data from GPI. 

Read carefully,
examine your data, evaluate the systematics, and let's find some planets...

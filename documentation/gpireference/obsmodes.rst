GPI Observing Modes
========================


The GPI instrument control software uses observing modes (FITS keyword ``OBSMODE``) to specify sets of instrument optical masks that
work together. Each obsmode consists of a unique set of 4 elements: {Filter, Apodizer, Focal plane mask, Lyot Mask}.  Obsmodes come in several basic flavors:

 * *Coronagraphic* observations, most common for GPI.
 * *Direct* observations, with no coronagraphic masks in use.
 * *Unblocked* (unocculted) observations, which use the coronagraphic Apodizer and Lyot mask but not the focal plane masks. These 
   are occasionally used, mostly for certain types of calibration observation
 * *NRM* modes for non-redundant mask interferometry
 * and a single *Dark* mode for detector calibrations. 

The defined Obsmodes are as follows. See :ref:`reference_coronagraph` for details on the individual elements.

Note that there are some "experimental" modes which are rarely, if ever, used. These are 

 * The "H Large Inner Working Angle" mode, which pairs the H band filter with the K1 focal plane mask and a specially optimized apodizer; in essence trading off worse inner working angle for (possibly) better starlight suppression. 
 * The "H Star" mode, which uses a shaped pupil binary apodization which is theoretically equivalent to the regular H_coron apodization. 

These modes are essentially uncommissioned and are not recommended for general use.

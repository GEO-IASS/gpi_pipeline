Data Parser
===================

The Data Parser looks at a collection of many FITS files, and based on header
keywords, identifies the observing modes and sequences present and generates
appropriate recipes to reduce the available data. 

Based on analysis of header keywords generated by Gemini & GPI
systems, the parser categorizes data by filters, data type (science,
calibration, standards), prism, occulter, object, exposure time, etc, and determines the appropriate template recipe to use on those data. 


How the Parser Generates Recipes
-------------------------------------



The Parser will preferentially identify calibration files and will order
their reduction recipes first, so that the up-to-date calibrations can be used for following science reductions. 

The parser scans through a collection of input files to determine the following for each file::


  *  filters (Y, J, H, K1, K2) 
  *  obstype (dark, flat, wavelength solution, object )
  *  disperser (spectral or polarimetric prism)
  *  occulter (blank, FPM)
  *  obsclass (Science, Astrometric Standard, etc)
  *  integration time
  *  Target object name

The parser arranges the resulting recipes in a given order::
        1. master darks, 
        2. measurement of the wavelength solution, 
        3. master flats
        4. Other calibrations
        5. science targets 

The recipes created by the Parser must be placed into the recipe queue to be
reduced.  There's a button the user can press to do this, and it is possible to configure the Parser to queue recipes automatically - but it is often the case that you want to check out and maybe adjust the automatic recipes before running them.

The Data Parser tool therefore allows the user to view and edit the
created recipes. Select the recipe to be edited and push the "View/Edit in
Recipe Editor" button to open the Recipe Editor.


Using the Parser
---------------------

To access the data parser, open the GPI launcher gui window by starting an idl session in your GPI data directory and typing 'gpi_launch_guis'. The top button in this window will open the Data Parser. 

Upon opening the Data Parser, the user must Add Files using the button in the top left corner of the window. The file names and choice header values will appear in the text box below.  Fits file can be removed from this list by first selecting the file and then the 'Remove' button. Alternatively, the 'Remove All' button will remove all the fits files from the Data Parser window.  

The Data Parser will read in the headers of the fits files and determine what type of recipe is most appropriate and fill in the table in the middle of the window. If the user wishes to use these recipes without editing, the 'Queue all Recipes' button in the bottom left corner may be used, or the user may select a subset of the recipes displayed in the table and use the 'Queue selected Recipes only' button at the bottom left. Additionally, the user may delete any recipe by selecting the Recipe File in the table and using the 'Delete Selected Recipe' button at the bottom middle of the window. If the user wishes to edit a recipe, select the recipe file in the table and use the 'Open in Recipe Editor button'. 

The Data Parser also includes the ability to sort the data by either the Date of Observation, the Filename, or the date the file was created. The output Data directory for any fits files created by a recipe can be changed manually in upper right of the data parser window. By default, the output directory used is the Reduced directory that was set up during pipeline configuration.

The GPI Data Analysis Team
----------------------------

Pipeline architecture design, initial algorithms development, core structure, GUI frameworks, and many primitives by **Jerome Maire** and **Marshall Perrin**.  

**Patrick Ingraham** developed and improved many of the primitives, led major aspects of IFS calibration and testing, and extensively contributed to this documentation.
**Dmitry Savransky** made major contributions to GPItv, pipeline back end infrastructure, and developed several pipeline primitives. 
**Jean-Baptiste "JB" Ruffio** vanquished many bugs, greatly enhanced the destriping and microphonics removal primitives, and wrote the original "Quick Start" section of the documentation.
**Max Millar-Blanchaer** improved the polarization mode primitives, and with **Sloane Wiktorowicz** calibrated the instrumental polarization.
**Schuyler Wolff** evaluated several aspects of instrument calibrations, tested developed improved methods of wavelength calibration, and contributed significantly to this documentation.
**Naru Sarakuni** extensively supported integration and test and contributed improvements to GPItv.
**Christian Marois** contributed to improving SDI algorithms and contrast measurement code. 
**Quinn Konopacky** developed the distortion correction primitive along with Jerome.
**Alexandra Greenbaum** is leading development of nonredundant aperture masking interferometry algorithms applied to GPI, and also contributed to this documentation.
**Jeff Chilcote** provided guidance on detector operations and calibrations. 
**Steven Beckwith** analyzed detector testing data to assess optimal readout modes. 
**Tyler Barker** implemented the KLIP algorithm, under guidance from Dmitry.
**Franck Marchis** oversees the computer infrastructure at the SETI Institute hosting software repositories and documentation, and supervised visiting student JB.


**Rene Doyon** was PI of the DRP subsystem for the GPI project, and provided top-level guidance in overall pipeline design. 
**James Graham** developed the core algorithm concepts for the polarization reduction, which were subsequently implemented by Marshall and enhanced by Max. 
**Bruce Macintosh** maintained overall coherence of the GPI project wavefront. 

From Gemini, **Stephen Goodsell** kept the project on track. **Carlos Quiroz** and **Fredrik Rantakyro** supported 
the Gemini Data System, including establishment of interfaces and extensive implementation and testing.
**Kathleen Labrie** provided valuable input from Gemini's perspective during software reviews.

The GPI pipeline software architecture was inspired by, and portions of the backbone
code re-used from, **the Keck OSIRIS pipeline**.  The OSIRIS pipeline was developed
by James Larkin, Shelley Wright, Jason Weiss, Mike McElwain, Marshall Perrin,
Christof Iserlohe, Alfred Krabbe, Tom Gasaway, and Tommer Wizanski. 


The Recipe Editor (aka ``DRFGUI``) was inspired by the OSIRIS ODRFGUI, orginally written in Java by Jason Weiss. Jerome Maire reimplemented it in a modified form in IDL, with assistance from Marshall Perrin.

gpitv is based on `atv by Aaron Barth et al.
<http://www.physics.uci.edu/~barth/atv/>`_   The Header Viewer dialog in gpitv
is taken from the `OSIRIS Quicklook tool
<http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/osiris/tools/>`_ ``ql2``, itself derived from
the NIRC2/NIRspec quicklook. The "Browse Files" dialog is based upon code
derived from David Fanning's tool `selectimage.pro
<http://www.idlcoyote.com/programs/catalyst/source/applications/selectimage.pro>`_. The GPI data pipeline is
built upon an extensive foundation of open source software from the astronomical community, including 
but not limited to the Goddard IDL Astronomy Pipeline, the JHUAPL library, Craig Markwardt's MPFIT library, 
Liam Gumley's IMDISP.PRO, and many other individual tools.

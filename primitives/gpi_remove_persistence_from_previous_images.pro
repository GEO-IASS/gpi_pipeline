; NAME: gpi_remove_persistence_from_previous_images
; PIPELINE PRIMITIVE DESCRIPTION: Remove Persistence from Previous Images
;
;   The removal of persistence from previous non-saturated images
;   incorporates a model developed for Hubble Space Telescopes Wide
;   Field Camera 3 (WFC3,
;   www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/ins_performance/persistence). 
;   Persistence is proportional to the intensity of the illuminating
;   source, and is observed to fade exponentially with time. The 
;   parameters of the mathematical model for the persistence, found
;   in the pipeline's configuration directory were determined
;   during integration and test at UCSC.
;
;   This primitive searches for all files in the raw data directory
;   taken within 600 seconds (10 min) of the beginning of the exposure
;   of interest. It then calculates the persistence from each image,
;   using the maximum of the stack, and subtracts it from the
;   frame. Note that if the detector is exposed to light, but no
;   exposures are being taken, persistence will still build up on the
;   detector that cannot be subtracted.  
;
;   Ideally, this program should be run after the destriping algorithm
;   as readnoise does not induce persistence. However, due to limitation
;   that a pipeline primitive cannot call another primitive, this has
;   not been implemented. Future developement will involve moving the
;   destriping algorithm into a idl function, and then calling the
;   function from the destriping primitive. This will enable the ability
;   for this primitive to destripe the previous images. The user should
;   note that the destriping is at a level that is low enough to not
;   leave a significant persistence, so this detail will not
;   significantly affect science data.
;
;   At this time, the persistence is removed at the ~75% level due to
;   inaccuracies in the model caused by an insufficient time sampling of
;   the initial falloff and readnoise. A new dataset will be taken prior to shipping,
;   and new model parameters will be derived prior to commissioning.
;
;	WARNING: Persistence removal does not (yet) work with COADDED images!
;
;	The manual_UTEND keyword allows the user to manually set the UTEND keyword in the image that is taken in closest time to the image being reduced. This is important because sometimes when changing modes or exposure times quickly, the CAL exit shutter can remain open so light will continue hitting the detector past the UTEND time. Users should note that this is generally occurs only for polarimetry snapshots after long spectral sequences (taken in the same band).

; INPUTS: Raw or destriped 2D image

; Unfortunately, the time that signifies the rate is not necessarily in

; NAME: gpi_remove_persistence_from_previous_images
; PIPELINE PRIMITIVE DESCRIPTION: Remove Persistence from Previous Images
;
; The removal of persistence from previous non-saturated images
; incorporates a model developed for Hubble Space Telescopes Wide
; Field Camera 3 (WFC3,
; www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/ins_performance/persistence). 
; Persistence is proportional to the intensity of the illuminating
; source, and is observed to fade exponentially with time. The 
; parameters of the mathematical model for the persistence, found
; in the pipeline's configuration directory were determined
; during integration and test at UCSC.
;
; This primitive searches for all files in the raw data directory
; taken within 600 seconds (10 min) of the beginning of the exposure
; of interest. It then calculates the persistence from each image,
; using the maximum of the stack, and subtracts it from the
; frame. Note that if the detector is exposed to light, but no
; exposures are being taken, persistence will still build up on the
; detector that cannot be subtracted.  
;
; Ideally, this program should be run after the destriping algorithm
; as readnoise does not induce persistence. However, due to limitation
; that a pipeline primitive cannot call another primitive, this has
; not been implemented. Future developement will involve moving the
; destriping algorithm into a idl function, and then calling the
; function from the destriping primitive. This will enable the ability
; for this primitive to destripe the previous images. The user should
; note that the destriping is at a level that is low enough to not
; leave a significant persistence, so this detail will not
; significantly affect science data.
;
; At this time, the persistence is removed at the ~75% level due to
; inaccuracies in the model caused by an insufficient time sampling of
; the initial falloff and readnoise. A new dataset will be taken prior to shipping,
; and new model parameters will be derived prior to commissioning.
;
; INPUTS: Raw or destriped 2D image
;
; Requires the persistence_model_parameters.fits calibration file.
;
; OUTPUTS: 2D image corrected persistence of previous non-saturated images
